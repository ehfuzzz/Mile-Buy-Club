SeatsAero Integration Debug - Thorough Investigation Required

PROBLEM:
The SeatsAero integration is completely broken in the backend. The /deals endpoint returns empty results and falls back to the database instead of showing real SeatsAero flight deals.

CURRENT STATUS:
- SeatsAero API works perfectly when called directly with curl
- Backend is running but SeatsAero service fails with "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.seats.aero" 
- Environment variables show correct base URL "https://seats.aero/partnerapi" but backend still uses old URL
- /deals endpoint returns userId "cmgx7c3mc000013ylf90bwphb" (database fallback) instead of "seats-aero"
- Debug endpoint /deals/debug exists but doesn't work

EVIDENCE:
1. Direct API call works:
curl -H "Partner-Authorization: pro_34GoHwfqK5fP3esJgqAhxv4cOmj" "https://seats.aero/partnerapi/availability?source=united&take=1"
Returns real flight data successfully.

2. Backend logs show:
ERROR [SeatsAeroPartnerService] Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.seats.aero
ERROR [DealsService] Falling back to stored deals after SeatsAero error

3. Environment configuration:
SEATS_AERO_API_KEY=pro_34GoHwfqK5fP3esJgqAhxv4cOmj
SEATS_AERO_BASE_URL=https://seats.aero/partnerapi
SEATS_AERO_TIMEOUT_MS=20000
SEATS_AERO_RPM=30
SEATS_AERO_RPH=500

KEY FILES TO INVESTIGATE:
1. apps/api/src/deals/seats-aero-partner.service.ts - SeatsAero service implementation
2. apps/api/src/deals/deals.service.ts - Main deals service that calls SeatsAero
3. apps/api/src/deals/deals.controller.ts - API endpoints including /deals/debug
4. apps/api/.env - Backend environment variables
5. .env.local - Root environment variables

SPECIFIC ISSUES TO DEBUG:
1. Why is the backend still trying to connect to "api.seats.aero" instead of "seats.aero/partnerapi"?
2. Are environment variables being loaded correctly in the SeatsAero service constructor?
3. Is the HTTP client configuration correct in the SeatsAeroPartnerService?
4. Why doesn't the debug endpoint work to show the actual error?
5. Is there a caching issue with the environment variables?

REQUIRED FIXES:
1. Fix the base URL configuration in SeatsAeroPartnerService
2. Ensure environment variables are loaded correctly
3. Make the debug endpoint functional
4. Verify the HTTP client setup
5. Test the complete integration end-to-end

EXPECTED RESULT:
The /deals endpoint should return real SeatsAero flight deals with userId "seats-aero" instead of falling back to the database.

PRIORITY: CRITICAL - This is blocking the core functionality of the application.

DEBUG COMMANDS TO USE:
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/deals/debug" | jq '.'
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/deals?limit=1" | jq '.meta.userId'

TESTING SEATSAERO API DIRECTLY:
curl -H "Partner-Authorization: pro_34GoHwfqK5fP3esJgqAhxv4cOmj" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "https://seats.aero/partnerapi/availability?source=united&take=1"

The SeatsAero integration must be fixed immediately. The backend should successfully call the SeatsAero API and return real flight deals instead of empty database results.
