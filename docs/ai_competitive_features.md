# AI Copilot Competitive Feature Map

## Overview
The Mile Buy Club AI copilot blends award-search automation, conversational planning, and multimodal intelligence. This document captures the differentiators we just shipped and outlines forward-looking features that keep us ahead of Layla.ai, Mindtrip, and emerging travel concierges.

## Current Highlights
- **Trip Copilot API** – Structured itinerary generation that fuses loyalty balances, watcher data, and live award/cash prices.
- **Conversational Memory** – Persistent sessions with tone control (concierge, executive, friendly, expert) and auto-suggested next steps.
- **Vision-Based Geo Intelligence** – Landmark recognition and vibe inference from traveler imagery, with outputs saved for itinerary enrichment.
- **Prisma Knowledge Graph** – Trip plans, daily experiences, AI sessions, media insights, and user preferences stored for analytics and personalization.

## Next-Gen Differentiators (Brainstorm)
1. **Autonomous Event Hopper** – Subscribe itineraries to live event feeds (Ticketmaster, Fever, Songkick) and auto-insert point-friendly experiences with hold options.
2. **Points Pooling Marketplace** – Facilitate secure, temporary sharing or topping up of loyalty balances within trusted circles before award holds expire.
3. **Live Price Freeze Radar** – Detect airlines/hotels offering low-cost holds or generous cancellation windows, prompting travelers to lock fares during flash sales.
4. **Adaptive Sustainability Mode** – Offer rail/coach alternatives, eco hotels, and carbon offsets while quantifying loyalty trade-offs and net emissions.
5. **Memory Graph + Travel Journal** – Convert chats, bookings, and analyzed media into polished stories, budgets, and shareable albums.
6. **Smart Companion Matching** – Privacy-aware opt-in to pair compatible travelers for sharing suites, award holds, or ground transport.
7. **Voice & Wearable Shortcuts** – Ambient trip updates via Apple Watch or smart speakers, with instant award rebooking prompts.
8. **Dynamic Resilience Engine** – Real-time disruption monitoring (weather, strikes) that auto-replans with backup awards/cash fares and pushes actionable alerts.

## Implementation Notes
- Prioritize features that leverage existing data assets (deals, trip plans, media insights) to minimize net-new integrations.
- Maintain clear guardrails for privacy and consent, especially for pooling, matching, and journaling features.
- Each differentiator should expose API hooks so both the web app and future mobile clients can consume the same intelligence layer.
