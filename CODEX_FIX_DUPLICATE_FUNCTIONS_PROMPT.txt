Fix SeatsAero Service Duplicate Function Errors and Multi-Airline Issues

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors:**
The SeatsAeroPartnerService has duplicate function implementations causing build failures:
- `getDiagnostics()` is duplicated at lines 227 and 449
- `describeError(error: unknown)` is duplicated at lines 236 and 458

Error messages:
```
src/deals/seats-aero-partner.service.ts:227:3 - error TS2393: Duplicate function implementation.
src/deals/seats-aero-partner.service.ts:236:3 - error TS2393: Duplicate function implementation.
src/deals/seats-aero-partner.service.ts:449:3 - error TS2393: Duplicate function implementation.
src/deals/seats-aero-partner.service.ts:458:3 - error TS2393: Duplicate function implementation.
```

2. **Multi-Airline Implementation Not Working:**
Despite implementing multi-airline support, the `/deals` endpoint only returns United Airlines flights.

Current behavior:
- API returns only United flights even with multi-airline code
- Direct SeatsAero API calls work for other airlines (American, Delta, etc.)
- Backend implementation appears correct but execution fails

REQUIRED FIXES:

1. **Remove Duplicate Functions:**
- Delete duplicate `getDiagnostics()` method (keep only one)
- Delete duplicate `describeError()` method (keep only one)
- Ensure the service compiles without TypeScript errors

2. **Debug Multi-Airline Issue:**
- Check if the multi-program iteration is actually executing
- Verify that API calls are being made for all programs
- Ensure error handling isn't silently failing for other airlines
- Add proper logging to see which programs are being called and their results

3. **Verify Implementation:**
- Confirm that `SEATS_AERO_PROGRAMS` array is being used correctly
- Check that `fetchDealsForProgram()` is being called for each airline
- Ensure rate limiting isn't blocking other airlines
- Verify that results are being properly aggregated

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
- TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- `/deals` endpoint returns flights from multiple airlines (American, Delta, United, etc.)
- Debug endpoint shows multiple airlines in results
- Backend logs show API calls to different airlines

TESTING COMMANDS:
```bash
# Should return flights from multiple airlines
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals?limit=10"

# Should show multiple airlines in results
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals?limit=20" | jq '.deals[] | .airline' | sort | uniq -c

# Debug endpoint should show multiple airlines
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals/debug"
```

PRIORITY: CRITICAL - The backend won't compile due to duplicate functions, and the multi-airline feature isn't working despite being implemented.

The goal is to fix the compilation errors and ensure the multi-airline SeatsAero integration actually returns flights from all available airlines, not just United.
