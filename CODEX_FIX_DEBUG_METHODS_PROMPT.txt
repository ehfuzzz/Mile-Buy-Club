Fix Missing Debug Methods and Multi-Airline Logging Issues

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

1. **Missing Debug Methods:**
The SeatsAeroPartnerService is missing essential debug methods that are being called by the deals service:
- `getDiagnostics()` method is missing (called by deals.service.ts line 635)
- `describeError()` method is missing
- Debug endpoint `/deals/debug` is failing silently due to missing methods

2. **Multi-Airline Implementation Not Working:**
Despite implementing multi-airline support with enhanced logging, the system still only returns United Airlines flights:
- API calls work for other airlines directly (American, Delta, etc.)
- Backend implementation appears correct but execution fails
- Cannot see the enhanced debugging logs due to missing debug methods

3. **Port Conflicts:**
Backend is experiencing EADDRINUSE errors on port 3001, suggesting multiple instances running.

REQUIRED FIXES:

1. **Restore Missing Debug Methods:**
Add the missing methods to SeatsAeroPartnerService:
```typescript
getDiagnostics() {
  return {
    baseUrl: this.baseUrl,
    configuredBaseUrl: this.rawBaseUrl ?? null,
    timeoutMs: this.timeoutMs,
    hasApiKey: Boolean(this.apiKey),
    supportedPrograms: SEATS_AERO_PROGRAMS,
    rateLimitInfo: {
      recentMinuteRequests: this.recentMinuteRequests.length,
      recentHourRequests: this.recentHourRequests.length,
    }
  };
}

describeError(error: unknown) {
  if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {
    const axiosError = error as AxiosError;
    return {
      type: 'axios_error',
      status: axiosError.response?.status,
      code: axiosError.code,
      message: axiosError.message,
      url: axiosError.config?.url,
    };
  }
  
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    return {
      type: 'error',
      name: error.name,
      message: error.message,
      stack: error.stack,
    };
  }
  
  return {
    type: 'unknown',
    value: String(error),
  };
}
```

2. **Fix Debug Endpoint:**
Ensure the `/deals/debug` endpoint works properly and shows:
- Service diagnostics
- Multi-airline execution results
- Program distribution summary
- Rate limiting status

3. **Enable Debug Logging:**
Make sure the enhanced logging added by Codex is visible:
- Multi-program execution logs
- Program-specific results
- Aggregation and deduplication logs
- Error details for failed programs

4. **Test Multi-Airline Functionality:**
Verify that the multi-airline implementation actually works:
- Test with specific airlines: `/deals?programs=american,delta`
- Test with all airlines: `/deals?limit=20`
- Check debug logs for program execution
- Verify results show multiple airlines

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
- Debug endpoint returns proper diagnostics and multi-airline results
- `/deals` endpoint returns flights from multiple airlines
- Backend logs show detailed multi-program execution
- No port conflicts or compilation errors

TESTING COMMANDS:
```bash
# Should return flights from multiple airlines
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals?limit=20" | jq '.deals[] | .airline' | sort | uniq -c

# Debug endpoint should show diagnostics and multiple airlines
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals/debug" | jq '.'

# Specific airlines should work
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals?programs=american,delta" | jq '.deals[] | .airline'
```

PRIORITY: CRITICAL - Debug methods are missing and multi-airline feature isn't working despite implementation.

The goal is to restore the missing debug methods and ensure the multi-airline SeatsAero integration actually returns flights from all available airlines with proper debugging visibility.
