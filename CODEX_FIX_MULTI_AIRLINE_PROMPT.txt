Fix Multi-Airline SeatsAero Integration - Only United Flights Returned

CRITICAL ISSUE:
The multi-airline SeatsAero integration is implemented but only returns United flights despite requesting multiple airlines.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
- `/deals` returns only United flights
- `/deals?programs=american,delta` still returns only United flights  
- Multi-airline implementation exists but not working

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- `/deals` should return flights from multiple airlines (American, Delta, Aeroplan, etc.)
- `/deals?programs=american,delta` should return only American and Delta flights
- Should see flights from 20+ airlines as implemented

DEBUGGING NEEDED:

1. **Check Multi-Airline Execution:**
The SeatsAeroPartnerService has multi-airline support implemented but execution is failing. Need to verify:
- Are all programs being requested from SeatsAero API?
- Are API calls succeeding for non-United airlines?
- Is the aggregation logic working correctly?

2. **Add Enhanced Logging:**
Add detailed logging to see what's happening during multi-airline execution:
```typescript
// In search() method, add logging for each program request
for (const program of normalizedPrograms) {
  this.logger.debug(`Requesting SeatsAero data for program: ${program}`);
  try {
    const programDeals = await this.fetchDealsForProgram({
      endpoint,
      program,
      params: baseParams,
    });
    this.logger.debug(`Program ${program} returned ${programDeals.length} deals`);
    aggregatedDeals.push(...programDeals);
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Program ${program} failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

3. **Test Individual Airline API Calls:**
Verify that SeatsAero API actually returns data for non-United airlines:
```bash
# Test American Airlines directly
curl "https://seats.aero/partnerapi/availability?take=5&source=american" \
  -H "Partner-Authorization: pro_34GoHwfqK5fP3esJgqAhxv4cOmj"

# Test Delta Airlines directly  
curl "https://seats.aero/partnerapi/availability?take=5&source=delta" \
  -H "Partner-Authorization: pro_34GoHwfqK5fP3esJgqAhxv4cOmj"
```

4. **Check Program Resolution:**
Verify that `resolvePrograms()` is correctly expanding airline names:
- american → american
- delta → delta  
- united → united
- etc.

5. **Debug fetchDealsForProgram:**
Ensure `fetchDealsForProgram()` is correctly adding the `source` parameter to API requests.

REQUIRED FIXES:

1. **Add Comprehensive Logging:**
- Log each program being requested
- Log API response counts per program
- Log any failures per program
- Log final aggregation results

2. **Verify API Parameter Construction:**
Ensure the `source` parameter is correctly added to SeatsAero API requests for each airline.

3. **Test API Responses:**
Verify that SeatsAero actually has data for multiple airlines (not just United).

4. **Fix Program Execution:**
If certain programs are failing, implement proper error handling and fallbacks.

TESTING COMMANDS:
```bash
# Should return multiple airlines
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals?limit=20" | jq '.deals[] | .airline' | sort | uniq -c

# Should return specific airlines only
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals?programs=american,delta" | jq '.deals[] | .airline' | sort | uniq -c

# Debug endpoint should show multi-program execution
curl "http://localhost:3001/deals/debug" | jq '.'
```

PRIORITY: HIGH - Multi-airline functionality is essential for the application.

FOCUS: ONLY fix the multi-airline issue. Do NOT modify booking URLs or other features.
