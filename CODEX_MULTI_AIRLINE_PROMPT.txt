SeatsAero Multi-Airline Integration Enhancement

CURRENT ISSUE:
The SeatsAero integration is currently only returning flights from United Airlines because the service is hardcoded to use `source=united` in the search parameters. We need to modify the system to fetch flight data from ALL available airlines/programs.

AVAILABLE AIRLINES:
Based on the SeatsAero API documentation, there are 24+ airlines/programs available:
- american (American Airlines)
- delta (Delta SkyMiles) 
- united (United MileagePlus)
- aeroplan (Air Canada Aeroplan)
- alaska (Alaska Mileage Plan)
- velocity (Virgin Australia Velocity)
- qantas (Qantas Frequent Flyer)
- flyingblue (Air France/KLM Flying Blue)
- jetblue (JetBlue TrueBlue)
- emirates (Emirates Skywards)
- etihad (Etihad Guest)
- qatar (Qatar Privilege Club)
- singapore (Singapore KrisFlyer)
- lufthansa (Lufthansa Miles&More)
- turkish (Turkish Miles & Smiles)
- finnair (Finnair Plus)
- ethiopian (Ethiopian ShebaMiles)
- saudia (Saudi AlFursan)
- eurobonus (SAS EuroBonus)
- virginatlantic (Virgin Atlantic Flying Club)
- aeromexico (Aeromexico Club Premier)
- connectmiles (Copa ConnectMiles)
- azul (Azul TudoAzul)
- smiles (GOL Smiles)

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
The SeatsAeroPartnerService.search() method is hardcoded:
```typescript
const params: Record<string, string | number | undefined> = {
  take: options.take && options.take > 0 ? Math.min(options.take, 200) : 50,
  skip: options.skip,
  source: options.program || 'united', // Default to United for now
};
```

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. **Modify SeatsAeroPartnerService.search() method:**
   - Remove the hardcoded `source=united` parameter
   - When no specific program is requested, make multiple API calls to fetch from all available airlines
   - Combine results from all airlines into a single response
   - Handle rate limiting appropriately (30 RPM, 500 RPH)

2. **Implement multi-airline fetching logic:**
   - Create a method to fetch from multiple airlines in parallel or sequentially
   - Aggregate results from all airlines
   - Remove duplicates if any
   - Sort results by score/quality

3. **Update the search parameters:**
   - Allow the API to accept a list of airlines to search
   - Default to searching all airlines when none specified
   - Maintain backward compatibility for single airline searches

4. **Handle rate limiting:**
   - Implement proper rate limiting across multiple API calls
   - Add delays between requests if needed
   - Respect the 30 RPM, 500 RPH limits

5. **Error handling:**
   - If one airline fails, continue with others
   - Log which airlines failed and which succeeded
   - Return partial results if some airlines fail

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- `/deals` endpoint should return flights from multiple airlines (American, Delta, United, Air Canada, etc.)
- Each deal should clearly indicate which airline/program it's from
- Results should be sorted by best deals/score
- No hardcoded airline limitations

FILES TO MODIFY:
1. `apps/api/src/deals/seats-aero-partner.service.ts` - Main service logic
2. `apps/api/src/deals/deals.service.ts` - Integration with deals service
3. Consider adding airline filtering options to the API

TESTING:
After implementation, test that:
- `/deals` returns flights from multiple airlines
- Each deal has the correct airline/program information
- Rate limiting is respected
- Error handling works for failed airlines
- Performance is acceptable with multiple API calls

PRIORITY: HIGH - This will significantly expand the flight deals available to users.

The goal is to transform the current single-airline (United only) system into a comprehensive multi-airline flight search that shows the best award deals across all major airlines and programs.
